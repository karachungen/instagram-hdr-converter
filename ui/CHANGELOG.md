## Migration Guide (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

### For Users

No migration needed - the UI is backward compatible with existing WASM files.

### For Developers

1. **TypeScript**: All code is now TypeScript. Update your imports:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { useWasm } from '~/composables/useWasm.js'

   // After
   import { useWasm } from '~/composables/useWasm'
   ```

2. **Type Imports**: Import types from the types directory:

   ```typescript
   import type { ProcessingFile, LogEntry } from '~/types'
   ```

3. **State Management**: Use `useState` for shared state:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   const files = ref([])

   // After
   const files = useState('files', () => [])
   ```

4. **Component Props**: Use TypeScript interfaces:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   const props = defineProps({
     file: { type: Object, required: true },
   })

   // After
   interface Props {
     file: ProcessingFile
   }
   const props = defineProps<Props>()
   ```

5. **Run Type Checking**:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```
